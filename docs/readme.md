# Hello

There are high level docs for most things within the framework, and its recommended you read over most of the docs here as well as the source code for most of the high level bits so you know the general core parts of the system and how they hang together.

As mentioned on the readme the best place to get more information outside of the docs are:

- Viewing the Online Demo @ [https://openrpg.github.io/OpenRpg](https://openrpg.github.io/OpenRpg)
- Asking Questions In the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/nKejjgT)

> The Online Demo goes into a lot more depth with code examples on how to do common things and in a lot of cases can be a better source of documentation than the docs provided here.
