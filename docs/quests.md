# `OpenRpg.Quests`

The quests project builds upon the `OpenRpg.Items` project to allow a way to express quests that can be carried out by players within the game.

A `Quest` is a `Template` that generally contains information about the `Objective`, the `Rewards` as well as other metadata as well as a way to track the state of completed quests and faction information.

> It is recommended you look over the interactive web demo for a more in depth example and explanation of this project.
